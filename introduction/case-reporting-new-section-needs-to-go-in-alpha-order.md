# Vaccine Workflows

This collection of workflows allows an external system with access to the HIE to save and retrieve vaccine status.   

The workflows are designed to support the following types of data exchanges with systems that have access to the HIE.

1. A system can record vaccine status to the HIE using the [Register / Store Document](shared-health-record/register-store-document.md) transaction.  
2. A system can query vaccine status from the HIE using the [Retrieve Document](shared-health-record/retrieve-document.md) transaction.
